Later, HT-3 start \\nup was initiated prior to completion of PSV (Pressure Safety Valve) installation, while PSV team was \\npreparing for PSV installation. Around 15:20 hrs, crude oil began overflowing from the open flange \\nof the PSV of HT-3. \\nThe fire was noticed shortly after the above incident in HT-3 area. One person got engulfed in the \\nfire and rushed to medical college but declared dead. \\nThe fire team along with the fire tender reported at site at around 15:22 hrs and the fire was \\nextinguished by 15:40 hrs and cooling down was initiated and site was declared all clear by 17:00 \\nhrs. \\n \\nOBSERVATIONS/ SHORTCOMINGS \\n \\n1. The feeding of crude to HT-3 was through RC 1 Pump. HT-3 and RC 1 were stopped for PSV \\ncalibration. Later, Pump RC-1 was started without ensuring the installation of PSV on HT-3. \\n2. JSA was prepared highlighting general hazards and precautions of PSV calibration. The following \\npoints of the JSA were not complied with. \\na. Depressurize the vessel and empty it before taking up the job. \\nb. Only remove the PSV after the vessel is depressurized. \\nc. Take the vessel in line only after fixing the PSV and observe for any abnormality. \\nNo record of Heater Treater HT-3, level or details of valves closed were found. No evidence of \\npositive isolation of HT-3 was found. \\n \\n3. Permit to Work (PTW) was created for the general job of PSV calibration at GGS, also it was not \\nan approved PTW. Also, the maintenance team took up some routine maintenance job on the \\npump RC-1 but no Work Permit was found for the same. The pump was locally locked out by \\nblocking on / off switch. No record of lock out / tag out (LOTO) found. \\n4. No record of Heater Treater HT-3, level or details of valves closed were found. No evidence of \\npositive isolation of HT-3 was found. \\nCASE STUDY \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"images\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
